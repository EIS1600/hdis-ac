This is a Handbook for Digital Islamicate Studies. Work in progress, based on tought courses. The current course, ``Computational Analysis of Data from Audition Statements--with R'', aims to introduce students to the main methods of data analysis that would be suitable for historical data. Students will learn the basics of the programming language R, which is one of the top choices in the field of Digital Humanities and Digital History. By the end of the course, students will understand how to work with data and how to extract the most valuable insights from it (exploratory data analysis). Students will practice on a dataset created from audition statements from medieval Damascus, thus also gaining original insights into the social history of medieval Islamic learning. There are no prerequisites for this course, except the basic knowledge of Arabic, since the data from audition statements is in Arabic. The course is complimentary to 57-521, where students will be learning how to read the original handwritten audition statements.

Students will learn the basics of the programming language R, which is one of the top choices in the field of Digital Humanities and Digital History. By the end of the course, students will understand how to work with data and how to extract the most valuable insights from it (exploratory data analysis).

The course is complimentary to 57-521, where students will be learning how to read the original handwritten audition statements.

Personal computers are required both for in-class work and for your homework. Your computer must run a full version of either Windows, MacOS, or Linux; unfortunately, neither tablets nor Chrome-based laptops are suitable for this course. No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with the command line and basic principles of programming will be beneficial.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\subsection*{Learning objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Learning objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Get basic familiarity with the programming language R;
\item
  Learn basic analytical techniques;
\item
  Gain an understanding of working with data and modeling data;
\item
  Practice these skills on a collection of historical data;
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{didactic-concept}{%
\subsection*{Didactic concept}\label{didactic-concept}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Didactic concept}

This is a hands-on practical course, which requires regular attendance and completion of homework assignments. The participants of the course are encouraged to attend weekly ``office hours'', where they can work on their homework assignments and get immediate feedback from the instructor. The main didactic approach of the course is to maximize the engagement of the participants with the programming language: this will provide a level of confidence and comfort in dealing with admittedly an alien subject within the scope of African and Asian studies; attaining this level of comfort is the key to absorbing the necessary theoretical, conceptual, and practical knowledge. Upon the completion of assigned tasks, the students are encouraged to bring their own datasets, since the engagement with their own data will provide a better grounding in this new subject.

\hypertarget{literature}{%
\subsection*{Literature}\label{literature}}

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%
\subsection*{Class Participation}\label{class-participation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Class Participation}

Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. Personal computers are required. We can accommodate whatever operating system you use (Windows, Mac, Linux), but it should be a full computer/laptop, not a tablet that uses an ``incomplete'' version of any major operating system. Don't forget that asking for help counts as participation!

\hypertarget{homework}{%
\subsection*{Homework}\label{homework}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Homework}

Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment, you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together on homework assignments, then when you submit it please include a brief note (just a sentence or two) to indicate who did what.

\textbf{NB:} On submitting homework, see below.

\hypertarget{final-project}{%

\section{Setting Things Up}\label{setting-things-up}}

\textbf{Important, like \emph{really-super-duper-important}!!!}:

We will need to set everything up so that it is much easier during the course. Creating folders and subfolders it is crucially important that you create them the exact way it is described below: 1) use only small letters; 2) instead of spaces between words, use ``\_'' (underscore). It is important that you set things up exactly like that. If you make mistakes in naming folders correctly, code that we will be using will most likely not work, because it will not be able to find files that it needs to load and/or save.

\textbf{Setting up our main folder:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{CADAS-R}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Create that folder in ``Documents'' (one of the default folders both on Mac and Windows); or anywhere else---ideally where you keep all your other folders related to other courses that you are taking; just remember where you create it;
  \item
    In your folder then create the following structure:
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
CADAS-R/
    ├── downloads/
    ├── data/
    │   ├── raw_data/
    │   └── processed_pata/
    ├── literature/
    │   ├── articles/
    │   └── books/
    ├── classes/
    │   ├── class_01/
    │   ├── class_02/
    │   └── class_03/
    ├── pPresentations/
    └── meeting_notes/
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{/downloads/}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    here we will store all the course-related files that you will be downloading;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{/data/}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    here we will keep files with our data;
  \item
    we will not really need \texttt{/raw\_data/} and \texttt{/processed\_data/}, but, usually, in your own future projects you may want to have such a division, to keep the original data in one folder and data that you have processed (cleaned, updated, etc.) in a different folder;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{/literature/}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is a way to organize readings, relevant to your project; we will keep here relevant files;
  \item
    Using bibliography managers, like Zotero, is a better option though;
  \item
    Download the following books, and place them in your folder (these are mainly for your reference):

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \url{https://www.dropbox.com/s/n1vp6ix87js0j5k/ArnoldHumanities2015.pdf?dl=0}

    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Note, how the names of PDFs are following the same pattern: \texttt{AuthorTitleYEAR.pdf}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{/classes/}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    here we will be placing files relevant to specific classes; mainly, these folders will keep the scripts that you will be working on;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{/presentations/}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A folder for your final presentation/project;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{/meeting\_notes/}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You may want to store your notes separately;
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{creating-a-project}{%
\section{Creating a Project}\label{creating-a-project}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  now that you have created everything, you need to create what is called a ``Project'' in RStudio. This will create a single file, which you can open in order to load all the necessary settings relevant to our course.
\item
  using ``Projects'' will help you to keep different research tasks separately and, most importantly, keep all the files relevant to specific tasks well-organized.
\end{itemize}

So, how to create a project?

\includegraphics{./images/r_instructions/new_project.png}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  open RStudio, then, in the main menu, choose: File \textgreater{} New Project (you should then see ``New Project Wizard'', as shown below);
\item
  Select ``Existing Directory'' \textgreater{} then click on ``Browse'', and then select the folder ``CADAS-R'', which you created in the first step; click ``Create Project'' to complete the process.
\item
  Now, what will happen is that in the tab ``Files'' in the lower right part of RStudio you will see the contents of the folder ``CADAS-R''. There will also be a new file, called \texttt{CADAS-R.Rproj}. Later on, you will be able to quickly open your project by double-clicking on that file. When you open the project, R automatically sets the working directory (\texttt{setwd()}) to the folder of the project and many things just become much easier.
\item
  Now, you can add and create new files relevant to your project in the folder ``CADAS-R'' and they will be easy to find directly from RStudio, using its ``Files'' Tab, which is usually available in the lower right corner. \textbf{Suggestion:} you will benefit greatly from keeping some order in your project folder. For example, keep all the files that you download in a subfolder ``downloads''; your your data files in a subfolder ``data'', and so on.

    \url{http://programminghistorian.org/} is a great resource for learning the basics of practical digital humanities. I encourage you to browse the lessons carefully, just to get a sense of what you can learn to do: \url{http://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/}. Please, read the following assigned lessons carefully. In some cases, it is well worth trying to repeat all the steps on your own computer. I will mark those.
  \item
    \textbf{Data organization}: understanding and applying basic principles of data organization will save you a lot of time in the future and will help you to keep your data well organized and easily accessible.

  \item
    \textbf{Command Line} is the most foundational tool for anyone interested in doing anything remotely interesting with computers. Unlike graphical-user-interfaces (GIU), here you give commands to the computer by typing them in directly. You will need one of the following two tutorials, depending on whether you use Mac or Windows. You should try to repeat at least some of the commands given in tutorials. These tutorials are a little bit more detailed than what you will need for now; the most important thing for you to understand is how to navigate your computer (i.s., move from one folder to another), copy and move files, create folders, etc.

  Creating our project:

  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{File} \textgreater{} \texttt{New\ Project}
  \item
    \texttt{Existing\ Directory}
  \item

  \item
    click \texttt{Create\ Project}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Using your Project:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    you now can open RStudio by clicking on the \texttt{CADAS-R.Rproj} file in your course folder; this will automatically adjust RStudio settings to that folder
  \item
    in \textbf{Files} (bottom-right corner) you will automatically see the folder of your project;

      review: what are relative and absolute paths?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Closing your Project:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you did any work with your project and then want to close it, RStudio will ask you if you want to \texttt{Save\ workspace\ image\ to\ ...}, click \texttt{Do\ not\ save}; while saving may be useful occasionally, in most cases that creates a large temporary file which makes your Rstudio slower.

  now we can try basic R operations:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    we can write them in our R script (top-left part of RStudio interface);
  \item
    we can also run them directly in \textbf{Console} (bottom-left part of RStudio interface);
  \item
    the main differences are:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      we can save all our commands in R script, but we cannot do that in console;
    \item
      console, however, is very useful for running commands that we do not want to save (for example, using help commands)
    \item
      R script is most useful when we want to do something complex and we need a series of commands that must run in a specific order; this will be the main use of R scripts (as well as R notebooks);
    \item
      In R script you can execute all commands one after another (as they appear in the script); in console you can execute only one command at a time;
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{basic arithmetic operations}: \texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, \texttt{*}, \texttt{/};

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    let's try some examples from what we pasted into our script;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{values and variables}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{values}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      when we simply typed our commands as we just did we use values, but they are gone as soon as we type the next one; variables allow us to preserve results for later reuse;
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{variables}:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      assignment operator (\texttt{\textless{}-} or \texttt{=}) and variable assignment;
    \item
      difference between \texttt{=} and \texttt{==};
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{comments}: we can use \texttt{\#} in front of any line to turn it into a comment; comment means that R will not try to execute it.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{built-in-functions}{%
\section{Built-in Functions}\label{built-in-functions}}

Let's add the following few lines to the end of our R script:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# built{-}in functions}

\NormalTok{numbers }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{9}\NormalTok{)}

\FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(numbers)}
\FunctionTok{min}\NormalTok{(numbers)}
\FunctionTok{mean}\NormalTok{(numbers)}
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(numbers)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R comes with some built-in functions, which have this format: \texttt{function(arguments)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    functions usually pack a few steps that transform and manipulate supplied data (\texttt{argument}) and return the result of those manipulations;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  in the code we created a vector (I will explain in a moment what vector is) names \texttt{numbers}
\item
  we can try some of the built-in functions and use this variable as an argument. What do you think the following functions will do?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{max()} :: ?
  \item
    \texttt{min()} :: ?
  \item
    \texttt{mean()} :: ?
  \item
    \texttt{sum()} :: ?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  functions may take/require a different number of arguments; arguments may be data that you supply and/or some parameters that trigger a specific behavior of a function;
\item
  in order to find out how a specific function works---and what arguments it takes, you can use help function or operator. For example, if we want to get help for the function \texttt{mean()}, we can do the following (type and execute):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{?mean} (or \texttt{??mean} --- this will give broader results);
  \item
    \texttt{help(mean)};
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thus, help tells us that \texttt{mean()} can take the following arguments:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{mean(x,\ trim\ =\ 0,\ na.rm\ =\ FALSE,\ ...)}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Alternatively, you can always google how to do a certain thing in R\ldots{}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{librariespackages}{%

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The concept of R packages and their role in extending R's functionality;

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    you can think of packages as additional programs for R (like MS Word on your computers that gives you a useful tool for writing your papers);
  \item
    packages give you access to more functions;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Packages can be installed:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    using the \texttt{install.packages()} function (the name of the library should be in quotation marks);

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      let's install \texttt{ggplot2} with this command;
    \item
      let's also install \texttt{stringi} with this command;
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    using interface: \textbf{Tools \textgreater{} Install Packages}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      let's install \texttt{tidyverse} via the interface;
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    let's also install library \texttt{swirl} :: you will need it for your homework;
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Packages can be loaded using function \texttt{library()} (or \texttt{require()});

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{library(ggplot2)}
  \item
    \texttt{library(tidyverse)}
  \item
    \texttt{library(stringi)}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Alternatively, you can call specific functions directly from specific libraries:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{stringi::stri\_rand\_lipsum(2)} :: try this example;
  \item
    this way is sometimes necessary when there are functions with the same name in different loaded packages;
  \item
    you can try to run the following line of code to generate a graph:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \texttt{ggplot2::ggplot(mtcars)\ +\ ggplot2::geom\_point(ggplot2::aes(x\ =\ mpg,\ y\ =\ hp))}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    this code becomes simple, if you have loaded the library \texttt{ggplot2} in advance:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \texttt{ggplot(mtcars)\ +\ geom\_point(aes(x\ =\ mpg,\ y\ =\ hp))}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{values-and-their-types}{%
\section{Values and their types}\label{values-and-their-types}}

There are several main types of values in R (these are the most important ones):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{numeric}: \texttt{3} or \texttt{3,14}
\item
  \emph{character}: \texttt{character} or \texttt{"3.14"}
\item
  \emph{logical}: \texttt{TRUE} or \texttt{FALSE}
\end{itemize}

You can check the type of value by using \texttt{class()} function, suppling the value or the variable as an argument.

You can convert between types:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{as.numeric()} to convert to numeric; you will not be able to convert to numeric a vector that contains letter characters;
\item
  \texttt{as.character()} to convert to character; any vector can be converted to character;
\end{itemize}

There are some other types, which we will cover when they become relevant.

\hypertarget{basic-data-structures-and-their-practical-usage}{%
\section{Basic Data Structures and Their Practical Usage}\label{basic-data-structures-and-their-practical-usage}}

One can say that everything in R revolves around vectors and vector algebra. This is not as scary as it may sound, but it has an extremely profound effect on how everything is done in R.

A vector is a fundamental data structure that represents a one-dimensional array containing elements of the same data type. Vectors are used to store and manipulate collections of values, such as numbers, characters, or logical values. They are the basic building blocks for more complex data structures like matrices, data frames, and lists.

Unless there is evidence to the opposite, you can assume that a variable/value is a vector. All operations in R work like vector operations, which makes R effective, efficient, and quite elegant.

Vectors in R are versatile and can be used to perform various operations, such as element-wise arithmetic, comparisons, and aggregations. R has a rich set of built-in functions for working with vectors, which makes it a powerful language for data manipulation and analysis.

Keep in mind that the elements of a vector must be of the same type. If you try to combine different types of elements in a vector, R will attempt to coerce the elements to a common type, following a hierarchy of types (logical \textless{} integer \textless{} double \textless{} character). For example, if you combine numeric and character values in a vector, R will convert the numeric values to character values. If you need to store elements of different types, you can use a list, which is a more flexible data structure in R.

In R, a vector is a one-dimensional array that can store a collection of values of the same type. You can create a vector using the \texttt{c()} function, which combines multiple values into a single vector. Here's an example of vectors. (Check what happens with \texttt{mixed\_vector}).

\hypertarget{data.framestibbles}{%
\subsubsection{Data.frames/tibbles}\label{data.framestibbles}}

A data frame is a table-like data structure in R, where each column can contain different types of data, and rows represent observations. A \texttt{tibble} (short for ``tidy data frame'') is a modern version of a data frame, introduced by the \texttt{tidyverse} package collection, which offers some improvements over the traditional data frame, such as better printing and subsetting.

\hypertarget{lists}{%
\subsubsection{Lists}\label{lists}}

In R, a list is a versatile data structure that can store a collection of values, where each element can be of a different type or even another data structure like a vector, matrix, or another list. You can create a list using the \texttt{list()} function. Here's an example of a list:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Define the data}
\NormalTok{names }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Alice"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Bob"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Charlie"}\NormalTok{)}

\hypertarget{rds-files}{%
\subsubsection{RDS Files}\label{rds-files}}

They provide a convenient and efficient way to save and load R objects such as vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, and models. RDS files use a compact representation, which makes them smaller in size and faster to read and write compared to text-based file formats like CSV or TSV.

You can save an R object to an RDS file using the \texttt{saveRDS()} function and load an R object from an RDS file using the \texttt{readRDS()} function.

RDS files are particularly useful when working with large datasets or complex objects, as they allow for fast and efficient storage and retrieval. However, keep in mind that RDS files are specific to R and may not be compatible with other programming languages or software without additional conversion.

Summary:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  quick and small, because they are binary;
\item
  very handy, because one can use the same command to save/load any data structure;
\end{itemize}
