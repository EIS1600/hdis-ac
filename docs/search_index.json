Romanov 2023-10-20 Preface This is a Handbook for Digital Islamicate Studies. Work in progress, based on tought courses. The current course, “Computational Analysis of Data from Audition Statements–with R”, aims to introduce students to the main methods of data analysis that would be suitable for historical data. Students will learn the basics of the programming language R, which is one of the top choices in the field of Digital Humanities and Digital History. By the end of the course, students will understand how to work with data and how to extract the most valuable insights from it (exploratory data analysis). Students will practice on a dataset created from audition statements from medieval Damascus, thus also gaining original insights into the social history of medieval Islamic learning. There are no prerequisites for this course, except the basic knowledge of Arabic, since the data from audition statements is in Arabic. The course is complimentary to 57-521, where students will be learning how to read the original handwritten audition statements.

By the end of the course, students will understand how to work with data and how to extract the most valuable insights from it (exploratory data analysis). Students will practice on a dataset created from audition statements from medieval Damascus, thus also gaining original insights into the social history of medieval Islamic learning. There are no prerequisites for this course, except the basic knowledge of Arabic, since the data from audition statements is in Arabic. The course is complimentary to 57-521, where students will be learning how to read the original handwritten audition statements. Personal computers are required both for in-class work and for your homework. Your computer must run a full version of either Windows, MacOS, or Linux; unfortunately, neither tablets nor Chrome-based laptops are suitable for this course. No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with the command line and basic principles of programming will be beneficial. Learning objectives Get basic familiarity with the programming language R; Learn basic analytical techniques; Gain an understanding of working with data and modeling data; Practice these skills on a collection of historical data; Didactic concept This is a hands-on practical course, which requires regular attendance and completion of homework assignments. The participants of the course are encouraged to attend weekly “office hours”, where they can work on their homework assignments and get immediate feedback from the instructor. The main didactic approach of the course is to maximize the engagement of the participants with the programming language: this will provide a level of confidence and comfort in dealing with admittedly an alien subject within the scope of African and Asian studies; attaining this level of comfort is the key to absorbing the necessary theoretical, conceptual, and practical knowledge. Upon the completion of assigned tasks, the students are encouraged to bring their own datasets, since the engagement with their own data will provide a better grounding in this new subject. Literature All the necessary study materials will be provided. Below you can find a list of additional materials. Course Evaluation: requirements for the full credit mandatory attendance and participation; timely homework assignments; final project (computational analysis + analytical commentary); no examination; Final projects can be prepared either individually or in groups. Class Participation Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. Personal computers are required. We can accommodate whatever operating system you use (Windows, Mac, Linux), but it should be a full computer/laptop, not a tablet that uses an “incomplete” version of any major operating system. Don’t forget that asking for help counts as participation! Homework Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment, you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together on homework assignments, then when you submit it please include a brief note (just a sentence or two) to indicate who did what. NB: On submitting homework, see below. Final Project Final project will be discussed later. You will have an option to build on what we will be doing in class, but you are most encouraged to pick a topic of your own. The best option will be to work on something relevant to your field of study, your term paper or your thesis. Additional Study Materials Arnold, Taylor, and Lauren Tilton. Humanities Data in R.

"],["setting-things-up.html", "1.2 Setting Things Up", " 1.2 Setting Things Up Important, like really-super-duper-important!!!: We will need to set everything up so that it is much easier during the course. Creating folders and subfolders it is crucially important that you create them the exact way it is described below: 1) use only small letters; 2) instead of spaces between words, use “_” (underscore). It is important that you set things up exactly like that. If you make mistakes in naming folders correctly, code that we will be using will most likely not work, because it will not be able to find files that it needs to load and/or save. Setting up our main folder: CADAS-R Create that folder in “Documents” (one of the default folders both on Mac and Windows); or anywhere else—ideally where you keep all your other folders related to other courses that you are taking; just remember where you create it; In your folder then create the following structure: CADAS-R/ ├── downloads/ ├── data/ │ ├── raw_data/ │ └── processed_pata/ ├── literature/ │ ├── articles/ │ └── books/ ├── classes/ │ ├── class_01/ │ ├── class_02/ │ └── class_03/ ├── pPresentations/ └── meeting_notes/ /downloads/ here we will store all the course-related files that you will be downloading; /data/ here we will keep files with our data; we will not really need /raw_data/ and /processed_data/, but, usually, in your own future projects you may want to have such a division, to keep the original data in one folder and data that you have processed (cleaned, updated, etc.) in a different folder; /literature/ This is a way to organize readings, relevant to your project; we will keep here relevant files; Using bibliography managers, like Zotero, is a better option though; Download the following books, and place them in your folder (these are mainly for your reference): https://www.dropbox.com/s/n1vp6ix87js0j5k/ArnoldHumanities2015.pdf?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/zfryoznbkogqssg/HadleyAdvanced2014.pdf?dl=0 https://www.dropbox.com/s/kh18de2cym65gfi/HadleyGgplot22016.pdf?dl=0 Note, how the names of PDFs are following the same pattern: AuthorTitleYEAR.pdf. /classes/ here we will be placing files relevant to specific classes; mainly, these folders will keep the scripts that you will be working on; /presentations/ A folder for your final presentation/project; /meeting_notes/ You may want to store your notes separately; "],["creating-a-project.html", "1.3 Creating a Project", " 1.3 Creating a Project now that you have created everything, you need to create what is called a “Project” in RStudio. This will create a single file, which you can open in order to load all the necessary settings relevant to our course. using “Projects” will help you to keep different research tasks separately and, most importantly, keep all the files relevant to specific tasks well-organized. So, how to create a project? open RStudio, then, in the main menu, choose: File &gt; New Project (you should then see “New Project Wizard”, as shown below); Select “Existing Directory” &gt; then click on “Browse”, and then select the folder “CADAS-R”, which you created in the first step; click “Create Project” to complete the process. Now, what will happen is that in the tab “Files” in the lower right part of RStudio you will see the contents of the folder “CADAS-R”. There will also be a new file, called CADAS-R.Rproj. Later on, you will be able to quickly open your project by double-clicking on that file. When you open the project, R automatically sets the working directory (setwd()) to the folder of the project and many things just become much easier. Now, you can add and create new files relevant to your project in the folder “CADAS-R” and they will be easy to find directly from RStudio, using its “Files” Tab, which is usually available in the lower right corner. Suggestion: you will benefit greatly from keeping some order in your project folder. For example, keep all the files that you download in a subfolder “downloads”; your your data files in a subfolder “data”, and so on.

I encourage you to browse the lessons carefully, just to get a sense of what you can learn to do: http://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/. Please, read the following assigned lessons carefully. In some cases, it is well worth trying to repeat all the steps on your own computer. I will mark those.

Command Line is the most foundational tool for anyone interested in doing anything remotely interesting with computers. Unlike graphical-user-interfaces (GIU), here you give commands to the computer by typing them in directly. You will need one of the following two tutorials, depending on whether you use Mac or Windows. You should try to repeat at least some of the commands given in tutorials. These tutorials are a little bit more detailed than what you will need for now; the most important thing for you to understand is how to navigate your computer (i.s., move from one folder to another), copy and move files, create folders, etc. Mac.
